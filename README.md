# Analysis-of-Customer-Purchasing-Behaviour-using-K-Means-Clustering (Unsupervised machine learning)

This study is designed primarily to enable organisations know the distinct kinds of customers they have. This will in turn help them to tailor customers' need based on the segment they fall into. 

The algorithm was created with two different user interface systems. These interface systems are Tkinter and user input.

The Tkinter interface can be used only after the exact columns to be used for analysis have been extracted and stored in a new file. At the time of running the algorithm, it prompts the selection of this file and number of clusters to be segmented into.

On the other hand, to use the user input interface, it is not necessary to pre-select the columns to be analysed and the system will prompt you to input your desired ciolumns with number of clusters.

The dataset used to test this algorithm was gotten from kaggle.com website. It has 5 attributes with 200 observations. The attributes are listed below:
1. Customer ID: It unique number to identify each customer. It categorical variable.
2. Gender: It is a categorical variable that contains male and female customers.
3. Age of customers which ranges between 18 years to 70 years old. It is numerical.
4. Income of customers between $15,000 and $70,000. It is numerical.
5. Spending score between 1 and 100 for each customer. It is numerical
