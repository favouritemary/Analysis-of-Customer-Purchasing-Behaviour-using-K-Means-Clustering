# Analysis-of-Customer-Purchasing-Behaviour-using-K-Means-Clustering (Unsupervised machine learning)

This study is designed primarily to enable organisations know the distinct kinds of customers they have. This will in turn help them to tailor customers' need based on the segment they fall into. However, the K-means clustering algorithm which was built from the scratch could be used for other segmentation purposes as it clusters group of people, observations, or objects with similar features.

The algorithm was created with two different user interface systems. These interface systems are Tkinter and user input.

The Tkinter interface can be used only after the exact columns to be used for analysis have been extracted and stored in a new file. At the time of running the algorithm, it prompts the selection of this file and number of clusters to be segmented into.

On the other hand, to use the user input interface, it is not necessary to pre-select the columns to be analysed and the system will prompt you to input your desired ciolumns with number of clusters.
